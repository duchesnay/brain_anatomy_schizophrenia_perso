# Predict schizophrenia using brain anatomy

Predict schizophrenia from brain grey matter (GM). schizophrenia is associated with diffuse and complex pattern of brain atrophy. We will try to learn a predictor of the clinical status (patient with schizophrenia vs. healthy control) using GM measurements on the brain participants.

## Dataset

There are 410 samples in the training set and 103 samples in the test set.

### Input data

Voxel-based_morphometry [VBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry)
using [cat12](http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/) software which provides:

- Regions Of Interest (`rois`) of Grey Matter (GM) scaled for the Total
  Intracranial Volume (TIV): `[train|test]_rois.csv` 284 features.

- VBM GM 3D maps or images (`vbm3d`) of [voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) in the
  [MNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talairach_coordinates) space:
  `[train|test]_vbm.npz` contains 3D images of shapes (121, 145, 121).
  This npz contains the 3D mask and the affine transformation to MNI
  referential. Masking the brain provide *flat* 331 695 input features (voxels)
  for each participant.

By default `problem.get_[train|test]_data()` return the concatenation of 284 ROIs of
Grey Matter (GM) features with 331 695 features (voxels) within a brain mask.
Those two blocks are higly redundant.
To select only on ROIs (`rois`) features do:

```
X[:, :284]
```

To select only on (`vbm`) (voxel with the brain) features do:

```
X[:, 284:]
```

### Target

The target can be found in `[test|train]_participants.csv` files, selecting the
`age` column for regression problem.

## Evaluation metrics

[sklearn metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)

The main Evaluation metrics is the Root-mean-square deviation
[ROC-AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic), the Area Under Curve of eceiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve

## Installation

This starting kit requires Python and the following dependencies:

* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplolib`
* `seaborn`
* `jupyter`
* `ramp-workflow`

Therefore, we advise you to install [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which include almost all
dependencies.

Only `nilearn` and `ramp-workflow` are not included by default in the Anaconda
distribution. They will be installed from the execution of the notebook.

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
You can install the dependencies with the following command-line:

```
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using conda, we provide an environment.yml file for similar usage.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, you can activate the environment using:

```
conda activate brain_anatomy_schizophrenia
```

And desactivate using

```
conda deactivate
```

## Getting started

1. download the data locally:

```
python download_data.py
```

2. Execute the jupyter notebook, from the root directory using:

```
jupyter notebook brain_anatomy_schizophrenia_starting_kit.ipynb
```

Tune your model using the starting_kit

3. Submission (Run locally)

The submissions need to be located in the `submissions` folder.
For instance for `starting_kit`, it should be located in
`submissions/submissions/starting_kit`.

Copy everything required to build your estimator in a submission file:
`submissions/submissions/starting_kit/estimator.py`.
This file must contain a function `get_estimator()`.

Run locally:

```
ramp-test --submission starting_kit
```

4. Submission on RAMP:
